# Port of the "Vulcan Retro" Enlightenment theme to e20

The original theme was created by 'Ndjee' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/Vulcan-Retro?content=61998).

It was later recompiled for a more recent version of e17 by 'Duma' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/Vulcan-Retro?content=155236).

With considerable help from Duma I have started porting the theme to e20 (hence also for e19). I am using the scalable background from a derivation of this theme, "R-Volcano R-E19" by 'rpil' from [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/R-Volcano+R-E19?content=167690).

Full credit goes to the artists and Duma. My role is limited to technical adaptation, since I really want to use this theme.

Please note that this is work in progress and not yet complete.
