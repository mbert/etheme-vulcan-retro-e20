# Port of the "Vulcan Retro" Enlightenment theme to e20

The original theme was created by 'Ndjee' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/Vulcan-Retro?content=61998).

It was later recompiled for a more recent version of e17 by 'Duma' and published [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/Vulcan-Retro?content=155236).

With considerable help from Duma I have started porting the theme to e20 (hence also for e19).
The theme _should_ be compatible with E version 20 upwards, but it has only be tested with (current) version 24.

From version 1.0.0 on there is support for rpm packaging. Ready-built packages for Fedora can be obtained from the [github page](https://github.com/mbert/etheme-blingbling-e20/releases). The spec is implemented in a simplistic way that should allow using it to create packages for other rpm-based distributions without any changes.

The scalable background and all the Elementary code are from a derivation of this theme, "R-Volcano R-E19" by 'rpil' from [here](http://e17-stuff.org/content/show.php/R-Volcano+R-E19?content=167690).

This theme has considerably benefitted from contributions to the 'blingbling' theme by Å tefan Uram 'thewaiter'.

Full credit goes to the artists, in particular 'rpil', 'Duma' and 'thewaiter'. My role is limited to technical adaptation and minor fixes, since I really want to use this theme.
